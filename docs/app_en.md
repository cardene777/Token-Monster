# Token Monster

## Overview.

- Farcaster Frame-based game.
- When you mint an NFT, you get 9 different monsters at random.
- After acquiring an NFT, you can check the minted monster in another Frame.
- By sending SuperTokens to monsters via superfluid, you can make them grow.

## Growing monsters

- A function that allows monsters to increase their level and evolve is under consideration, for example.
- Users can grow monsters not only by receiving SuperTokens, but also by passing them on.
- They can watch them grow gradually by giving them funds in a fluid manner.

## Getting data.

- Basically, level data and other data are stored in a DB.
- The flow of SuprtFluid funds is obtained via the graph.
- The reason for this is to get on-chain information as quickly as possible.

## Issues

- One of the reasons why progress was slower than expected this time is that base sepolia does not exist in the super native token of superfluid.
- If it is possible to add base sepolia here, we would like to ask you to do so.
- If it is difficult, I will try my best to add it as an individual.
